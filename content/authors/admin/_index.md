I'm a dane, currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia. Here I'm pursuing a PhD in experimental condensed matter physics at the University of British Columbia, working at the [Quantum Devices Group](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~qdev/?p=home). I'm currently focusing on two topics: Topological qubits in proximitized 1D InAs nanostructures and emerging anomalous metallic phases in InAs/Al SIT samples.

I received my Masters degree in 2015 from University of Copenhagen, where I worked at the [Center for Quantum Devices](https://qdev.nbi.ku.dk). During my Masters I studied the properties of Fractional Quantum Hall quasi-particles, using QPC's.

Before entering the exciting world of academia, I trained to become an electrician. I received my certificate in 2009 and was at the same time awarded the bronze medal as well as the Massmannske medal of silver.
